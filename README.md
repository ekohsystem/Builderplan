# WIP for DevOps Assignment
This is a test project to explore Github

Please be reminded to:
* Please drink more water and ask questions.


Workflow Overview
* Merged code -> Test -> Build -> Deployment

How Github Actions automate these workflows? 
* When something happens IN or TO your repository (i.e. Github events), automatic Actions are exceuted in response.
* 1) Listen to EVENT
* 2) Trigger workflow

E.g. CI/CD with Github Actions
* Commit code -> Test - > Build -> Push -> Deploy
* Advantages : Use same tool instead of 3rd party integration
*              setup the pipeline is easy
*              tool for developer
*              it integrates with other technologies 
*              Give us the environment we specify and simply connect to target and deploy
